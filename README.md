# Pantry-Planner
Cook creatively with what you already have!

---

## The Problem
Many of us struggle with meal planning, often leading to food waste and last-minute grocery trips. We end up buying ingredients we already have or cooking the same dishes repeatedly because we don't know what's in our pantry. The "Pantry Planner" solves this common household problem by helping users efficiently manage their food inventory and get inspired by what's already available.

## Features
Pantry Planner is a user-friendly web application designed to simplify meal preparation and grocery management.

* **Pantry Inventory:**  Users can add and track all the food items they have in their kitchen, including expiration dates, to reduce waste.

* **Recipe Search by Ingredient:**  Instead of searching for recipes and then checking for ingredients, our app lets you find recipes based on the ingredients you already have in your pantry.

* **Intuitive User Interface:**  The clean and simple design makes it easy for anyone to navigate and quickly find what they need.

* **Responsive Design:**  The application is built to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack
This project was built using a standard front-end web development stack:

* **HTML:**  For the website's structure and content.

* **CSS:**  For styling, layout, and animations.

* **JavaScript:**  For dynamic functionality and user interaction.
